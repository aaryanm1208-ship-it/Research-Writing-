# System Architecture – AQI Tracker

## Overview
The Real-Time Air Quality Index Tracking System is designed to monitor air pollutants continuously and display AQI values in real time.

## Components
- Air Quality Sensors (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO₂)
- Microcontroller / Data Acquisition Unit
- Backend Server
- Database
- Web Dashboard

## Data Flow
1. Sensors collect pollution data
2. Data is transmitted to the backend
3. AQI is calculated using standard formulas
4. Results are stored and visualized in real time
