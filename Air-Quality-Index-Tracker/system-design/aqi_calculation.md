# AQI Calculation Methodology

The AQI value is calculated based on pollutant concentration levels using standard breakpoint values.

## Formula
AQI = ((I_high - I_low) / (C_high - C_low)) × (C - C_low) + I_low

## Parameters
- C: Measured pollutant concentration
- C_high, C_low: Concentration breakpoints
- I_high, I_low: AQI index breakpoints

This ensures accurate representation of air quality conditions.
